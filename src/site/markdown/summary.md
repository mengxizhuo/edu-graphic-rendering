# Project Summary

## Architecture Overview

The Graphic Rendering System is structured around several key components:

1. **Shape Models**: Core shape classes (Circle, Rectangle, Line, Triangle) that inherit from the abstract Shape class
2. **Renderers**: Different rendering strategies (Console, SVG, Swing) implementing the Renderer interface
3. **Command System**: Implementation of the Command pattern for undo/redo functionality
4. **Factory System**: Factory classes for creating shapes and renderers
5. **Observer System**: Implementation of the Observer pattern for monitoring shape changes
6. **Visitor System**: Implementation of the Visitor pattern for exporting shapes
7. **Adapter System**: Implementation of the Adapter pattern for third-party renderers
8. **Proxy System**: Implementation of the Proxy pattern for remote rendering
9. **Utility Classes**: Supporting functionality like file management

## Design Pattern Implementation

### Factory Pattern
The system uses factories to create shapes and renderers, allowing for flexibility in object creation.

### Command Pattern
All operations that modify the drawing are encapsulated as commands, enabling undo/redo functionality.

### Observer Pattern
Shape changes are monitored through the Observer pattern, allowing for reactive updates.

### Adapter Pattern
Third-party renderers are integrated through adapters, enabling compatibility with external systems.

### Visitor Pattern
The Visitor pattern is used for exporting shapes to different formats without modifying the shape classes.

### Proxy Pattern
Remote rendering is facilitated through the Proxy pattern, providing a local interface to remote rendering services.

### Singleton Pattern
Configuration management is handled through a singleton, ensuring a single point of access to configuration data.

## Technical Stack
